\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisour Markus Pernpointner,
for his support through the years of my PhD and for giving me the freedom to
follow my own visions.

Furthermore I would like to thank Andreas Dreuw, who spontaneously agreed to
step in as second referee of my thesis.

I am grateful for the financial support from the Graduiertenkolleg 850, DAAD
and Prof. Dr. Lorenz Cederbaum, who enabled funding in the last year.

I would like to thank
\begin{itemize}
 \item the members of the Theoretical Chemistry group for wonderful and
       inspiring working conditions and social recreations, especially
       the classical quartett and the climbing group
 \item the Dirac family for their encouragement, the hearty working
       atmosphere and companionship at conferences around the world
 \item the system administrators of the TC group:
       Axel Lode, Evgeniy Gromov, Frank Otto,
       Markus Schröder and Victor Vysotskiy for their commitment and patience
       with my requests for new programs or newer compiler versions
 \item my research internship student Sebastian Pallmann for his work
       on the NeAr clusters as well as questioning the foundations of my ansatzes
       and thereby challenging me to find proper answers
 \item the students of my tutorials asking a lot of questions, which gave
       me the opportunity to look at generally accepted concepts from
       a variety of different perspectives
 \item P\v{r}emysl Koloren\v{c} for explaining the concepts of FanoADC
       and Stieltjes as well as their non-relativistic implementations to me
 \item Vitali Averbukh for allowing me to use his Stieltjes code
 \item Radovan Bast for his continuous understanding and help with git,
       cmake and automatic testing as well as always finding 
       new tools which make coding more elegant and efficient
 \item Caroline Krauter, Ghazal Jabbari, Jochen Schirmer, Kirill Gokhberg,
       Marko Förstel, J. Patrick Zobel,
       P\v{r}emysl Koloren\v{c},
       Sören Kopelke, Vasili Stumpf and Uwe Hergenhahn for fruitful discussions
 \item Marko Förstel and Uwe Hergenhahn for performing the experiments
       for my systems of interest and providing me with experimental input data
 \item the Theoretical Physics group of the Charles University of Prague for
       their hospitality during my visits
 \item my office mates Axel Lode, Caroline Krauter, Julian Grond and Markus
       Schröder, who made everyday work special
 \item Annika Bande, Arina Rybina, Axel Lode, Caroline Krauter, Jochen Schirmer,
       Kirill Gokhberg, Lorenz Cederbaum, Marko Förstel, Markus Hammermann,
       Markus Schröder, J. Patrick Zobel, P\v{r}emysl Koloren\v{c},
       Radovan Bast, Sabine Kopec, Solveig Scholl, Stefan Knecht
       and Vasili Stumpf for their helpful comments on the manuscript
 \item the Heidelberger Motettenchor for many nice rehearsals and concerts,
       as well as their sympathies and encouragements especially in the period
       of thesis writing
 \item Solveig Scholl for ripping me out of my mental roundabouts and
       joining me to the swimming bath
 \item the Geocachers for nice hikes and riddle solvings
\end{itemize}

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their understanding,
their support, their patience and love.
