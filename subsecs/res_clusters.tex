\chapter[Heteroatomic Noble Gas Clusters]{Competing Processes in Heteroatomic Noble Gas Clusters}
\label{chapter_clusters}

The modelling of secondary electron spectra stemming from \ac{ICD}
and \ac{ETMD}3 processes are carried out using the programme
HARDRoC \cite{HARDRoC}, which is based on the model of pairs and
triples explained in chapter \ref{chapter:geom} and is applied
to a given cluster structure. The obtained
decay widths are proportional to the probability of the underlying decay.
The experimental spectra are obtained from a multitude of distinct measurements.
Hence, for a reasonable large number of measurements, a distribution with the
same statistical behaviour as for the decay width calculation in the
model of pairs and triples is achieved. Therefore, the experimental spectra
can be directly compared with the theoretically obtained spectra.

For the actual calculation the energies of the secondary electrons are obtained
from equation \ref{equation:E_sec}. The single ionization energies
can be obtained in two different ways. They can be
approximated by the atomic ionization energies in Table
\ref{table:noble_atom_properties} corrected by energetic shifts
given in Table \ref{table:cluster_shifts} in order to take
the effect of the cluster environment into account. 
Alternatively, they can be taken from the single ionization spectrum
measured at the same time and the same conditions as the electron-electron
coincidence experiment. The latter is to be preferred, since the energy shifts
of Table \ref{table:cluster_shifts} are obtained from homonuclear clusters and
hence only give a first approximation to the real energetic shift in
heteronuclear cluster. Since both the \ac{ICD} and even more clearly the
\ac{ETMD}3 occur at the interfaces, it is crucial for a good modelling to
describe the ionization energies of these atoms as accurate as possible.

The decay widths $\Gamma$ can either be obtained from the asymptotic expressions
in equations (\ref{reltheolifetime_exp}) and (\ref{reltheolifetimeetmd_exp})
using the atomic properties given in Table \ref{table:noble_atom_properties}
or from a fit to decay widths obtained from FanoADC Stieltjes calculations.

In the following sections two different heteronuclear clusters are investigated
illustrating different effects on the secondary electron spectra.
In the case of ArXe clusters I will focus on the effects of spin-orbit coupling
on the secondary electron spectra. Furthermore, I will investigate the influence
of the cluster size and number of argon shells around the xenon core and
the influence of the basic structure of the cluster and show the
difference of the spectra
obtained from clusters having an icosahedral
and \ac{fcc} structure.
In the case of NeAr clusters I will focus on the bidirectional dependence of
the ICD spectra of the competing NeNe-ICD and NeAr-ICD processes and
different arrangements of neon atoms around the argon core.
