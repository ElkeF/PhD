\section{Special Relativity}

The theory of relativity describes physical properties depending on the movement
of the inertial system.
The special relativity was first proposed
by ALbert Einstein in 1905 \cite{Einstein05} and postulates the equality of
the laws of physics in uniformly moving inertial systems.
It was motivated by the possibility to unitize the classic mechanics with
the electrodynamics.

The special relativity is thereby based on two postulates:
\begin{enumerate}
\item principle of relativity: All physical laws are the same in all uniformly
      moving relative to each other.
\item The speed of light is constant in vacuum and independent of the location
      and movement of the light source.
\end{enumerate}

Their consistent application lead to a new understanding of space and time
and awareness that energy and mass are equivalent.\cite{nolting4}


\section{Lorentz-Transformation}
The Lorentz transformation replaces the Galilei transformation of the
non-relativistic description for the transition between two inertial systems
$\Sigma$ and $\Sigma'$.
In contrast to the latter it takes into account that information can not travel
faster than the speed of light.
Without loss of generality $\Sigma$ can be supposed to be resting. Consider the
the second inertial system $\Sigma'$ to move in $x$ direction and the two
inertial systems to coincide at time $t=0$. Under these conditions, the spacial
coordinates transform as equation (\ref{lorentz1}) and equation (\ref{lorentz2}).
Without a relative movement in a certain direction, the corresponding coordinates
$y=y'$ and $z=z'$ do not change.

\begin{eqnarray}\begin{array}{rcl}\label{lorentz1}
 x'  &=& \gamma\left(x-\beta ct\right)\\
 ct' &=& \gamma\left(ct-\beta x\right)
\end{array}\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}\begin{array}{rcl}\label{lorentz2}
 x   &=& \gamma\left(x'+\beta ct'\right)\\
 ct  &=& \gamma\left(ct'+\beta x\right)
\end{array}\end{eqnarray}

This way two new variables are introduced: the ratio between the relative speed
and of the inertial systems and the speed of light $\beta = \frac vc$ and the
Lorentz factor $\gamma = \frac 1{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}$.

For small relative speeds, or alternatively $c\rightarrow\infty$, the Lorentz
transformation equals the Galilei transformation.

Since in all inertial systems the same laws of physics have to hold, these laws
have to be invariant with respect to the Lorentz transformation. Therefore

Since all fundamental laws of physics need to hold in all inertial systems,
they need to be invariant under Lorentz transformation. Hence, they need to be
reformulated with respect to the new set of coordinates according to
the principles of relativity. \cite{einstein88}


\section{Space-Time}
From the latter section it is obvious that distances and times are not
invariant to a Lorentz transformation. Therefore they can not be treated
separately. But, motivated by the evolution of a spherical wave, one corresponding
invariant property can be found, which is the square of the space-time $s$

\begin{equation}\label{linvarianz}
 s^2 = x^2 - \left(ct\right)^2 = x'^2 - \left(ct'\right)^2
\end{equation}

with

\begin{equation}\label{vierervec}
 \mathrm{s} = \begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\z\\ict\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}



\subsection{Relativistic Mechanics}
Starting from the four dimensional space time the relativistic velocity vector $u$
and the corresponding canonical or linear? momentum $p=mu$ can be derived.
Furthermore it can be shown that the mass of an object also depends on the
velocity of the moving particle with respect to the observer. Here, $m_0$ is the
mass of the particle at rest.

\begin{equation}\label{relmasse}
m = \gamma m_0
\end{equation}

Considering the acceleration of the particle leads to the famous relation between
energy and mass $E=mc^2$, which is the sum over the rest mass energy and the
kinetic energy of the particle.

Utilizing the relativistic momentum the following relation for the energy can be
obtained

\begin{equation}\label{relE}
E = \sqrt{p^2c^2 - m_0^2c^4}
\end{equation}

Because of the Lorentz invariance of $p^2 -\frac{E^2}{c^2} = -m_0^2c^2$
the definition of the momentum vector can be defined as

\begin{equation}\label{viererp}
\mathbf{p} = \begin{pmatrix}\frac{iE}{c}\\p_x\\p_y\\p_z
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

In the following, all masses $m$ are to be considered as the corresponding
rest masses $m_0$.

\subsection{Relativistic Electrodynamics}
The Maxwell equations describing the interactions of magnetic and electric fields
and charged particles are already Lorentz covariant. Therefore, their shape
is conserved under Lorentz transformation and the modifications to the
non-relativistic formulation are limited to the introduction of a four-component
vector potential

\begin{equation}
A = \begin{pmatrix}\frac{\phi}{c}\\\mathbf{A}\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{A}$ is a three dimensional vector potential and $\phi$ is a scalar
potential.



\section{Relativistic Quantum Mechanics}
Motivated by the knowledge of the relativistic phenomena in classical mechanics
the quantum mechanics where reformulated accordingly, which lead to the substitution
of the Schrödinger equation by the Dirac equation. We will first discuss basic
properties of the relativistic effects on a freely moving particle and afterwards
use these basics for the description of the hydrogen atom and later for the more
complex many particle systems.

\subsection{Klein-Gordon Equation for a Freely Moving Particle}
By utilizing the correspondence principle and substituting the classical variables
by their quantum analoga one obatins for the square of the relativistic energy



\begin{equation}\label{kgg}
E^2\Psi = \left(i\hbar \frac\partial{\partial t}\right)^2\Psi = \left(m^2c^4-\hat{\mathbf{p}}^2c^2\right) \Psi
\end{equation}
This expression is known as the Klein-Gordon equation and describes the movement of
a spinless particle.\cite{kellogg97}
Even though equation (\ref{kgg}) is Lorentz covariant it needs some further
investigation. First, its solutions enables negative energies, which so far have
no proper interpretation and second, the corresponding time-dependent probability
density $\Psi^*(\vec{r},t)\Psi(\vec{r},t)$ is not positive definite, which
contradicts the probabilistic picture of quantum mechanics.

Despite these weaknesses the Klein-Gordon equation was the basis for the
derivation of the Dirac equation.


\subsection{Dirac Equation}
The derivation of the Dirac equation was motivated by the description of the
moving electron. It was found later that it holds for fermions with a spin of
$\frac12$.
Special relativity requires a treatment of time and spacial coordinates on an
equal footing. Since the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation contains the first
derivative with respect to time and the second derivative with respect to the spacial
coordinates, the necessity of a reformulation is obvious.


\subsubsection{Dirac Equation for a Freely Moving Particle}\label{freep}
1928 Dirac established his famous equation which incorporates first order
derivatives of both time and spacial coordinates \cite{Dirac28_1}

\begin{equation}\label{diracg}
i\hbar \frac\partial{\partial t} \Psi = c (\alpha\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}}+\beta mc) \Psi
\end{equation}

The variables $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have to determined appropriately considering
the relations based on the comparison of the Dirac equation to the Klein-Gordon
equation
\begin{align}
\left[\alpha_i,\alpha_j\right]_+ = \alpha_i\alpha_j + \alpha_j\alpha_i
                                &= 2\delta_{ij}\\
  \alpha_i\beta + \beta\alpha_i &= 0 \\
  \beta^2                       &= 1
\end{align}

Since numbers do not commute, the variables obviously are matrices.
They have eigenvalues of either $+1$ or $-1$, their traces have to be 0
and their dimension has to be even. These requirements are fulfilled by the
three Pauli matrices. However, in order to describe four parameters, a set of
at least four matrices is required. Therefore a dimension of at least four is
mandatory. In case of $4\times 4$ matrices more than one set fulfilles the
requirements. The one conventionally used is constructed from the Pauli matrices
and reads as

\begin{equation}\begin{array}{lll}
\alpha_x= \left(\begin{array}{cccc}
0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{array}\right)&
\alpha_y = \left(\begin{array}{cccc}
0 & 0 & 0 & -i\\
0 & 0 & i & 0\\
0 & -i& 0 & 0\\
i & 0 & 0 & 0\end{array}\right)&
\alpha_z = \left(\begin{array}{cccc}
0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 &-1\\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & -1& 0 & 0
\end{array}\right)
\end{array}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\beta = \left(\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 &-1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 &-1
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}


Due to the matrix dimension of the operators, the wave function $\Psi$ has to have
the same dimension and hence is represented by a four dimensional vector

\begin{equation}
\Psi = \begin{pmatrix}
\Psi_1\\\Psi_2\\\Psi_3\\\Psi_4
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

A very convenient way of writing the Dirac equation (\ref{diracg})
using $\alpha$ and $\beta$
is the two-component form

\begin{equation}\label{dirac2}
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
-E +mc^2 & c(\mathbf{\sigma}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}})\\
c(\mathbf{\sigma}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}}) & -E-mc^2
\end{array}\right)
\begin{pmatrix}\Psi^L\\\Psi^S\end{pmatrix}
=0
\end{equation}
Here, $E$ is the energy of the freely moving particle, $\hat{\mathbf{p}}$ denotes
the three dimensional momentum operator and $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is the row vector
containing the Pauli matrices. In this formulation the wavefunction is partitioned
into the so-called large and small components depicted by the superscripts $L$ and
$S$ of the wavefunctions $\Psi$, respectively.

The latter eigenvalue equation (\ref{dirac2}) can be written as two coupled
differential equations

\begin{equation}\begin{array}{rcl}
(-E+mc^2)\Psi^L + c(\mathbf{\sigma}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}}) \Psi^S &=& 0\\
c(\mathbf{\sigma}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}}) \Psi^L +(-E-mc^2)\Psi^S &=& 0
\end{array}\end{equation}

which yield a relation between the large and the small component of the
wavefunction, which is important for the description of relativistic
many particle systems.

\begin{equation}\label{zusklgr}
\Psi^S = \frac{c(\mathbf{\sigma}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}})}{E+mc^2}\,\Psi^L
\end{equation}

Inserting equation (\ref{zusklgr}) into the first equation in (\ref{dirac2})
yields
\begin{equation}
(-E+mc^2)\Psi^L + \frac{c^2(\mathbf{\sigma}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}})^2}{E+mc^2}\,\Psi^L = 0
\end{equation}

In general the energies can be shifted to any meaningful value, which then
serves as a knew reference energy. For a comparison with the non-relativistic result,
it is convenient to shift the energies such
that the kinetic energy of the particle coincides with the positive energy as
in the non-relativistic description. Hence, the energies are shifted by $mc^2$.
The non-relativistic limit in then achieved by letting $c$ approach infitnity.

\begin{equation}
E'\Psi^L = \frac{c^2(\mathbf{\sigma}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}})^2}{E'+2mc^2}\,\Psi^L\label{hamneu}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\lim_{c\rightarrow\infty} E'\Psi^L = \frac{(\mathbf{\sigma}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}})^2}{2m} \qquad\text{with}\quad (\mathbf{\sigma}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}})^2=\hat{\mathbf{p}}^2\label{nonrelgr}
\end{equation}

Obviously, equation (\ref{nonrelgr}) is equivalent to the non-relativistic
eigenvalue problem with the large component of the wavefunction as eigenfunction.
The two components can be identified with the two possible spin states.

The solution of the Dirac equation leads to both positive and negative energy
eigenvalues $E_+$ and $E_-$

\begin{equation}
E_\pm = \pm \sqrt{m^2c^4+p^2c^2}.
\end{equation}

Bild

This means, that two continua of eigenvalues exist with an energy gap of $2mc^2$
as shown in figure \ref{}.
Particles at rest always have the energy $mc^2$ and hence positive energies.
Such particles should normally deexcite to a state of lower energy and emit
the excess energy as a photon. In order to take care of this unphysical behaviour
Dirac postulated that all states of negative energies are occupied and hence
inaccessible. An excitation of an electron from the negative energy region into
the positive energy region would then correspond to a pair creation process yielding
an electron and a hole. This hole needs to have the same mass and the opposite charge
of the electron and was called positron. It was experimentally found and hence the
theory was verified in 1933
\cite{Anderson33}. However, it has to be noted that even though the Dirac equation
allows for the description of such a pair creation process and motivated further
theoretical investigation, the more rigorous
description for all kinds of interactions between particles and electromagnetic
fields is described by the \ac{QED}. The latter will also be important for the
description of interaction between electrons in many particle systems.



\subsubsection{Solution of the Dirac Equation for the Hydrogen Atom}\label{hatom}
The hydrogen atom is the most simple system of quantum chemistry. Its solutions
are the basement for the description of any more complex system.
In the hydrogen atom the electron is no longer moving freely but within the Coulomb
field of the proton. The proton is assumed to be fixed in space and hence the
potential in which the electron moves can be described by the scalar potential
$\phi=\frac{eZ}r$ only. The other components of the four dimensional potential $A$
are zero. Therefore the electronic part of the time-independent Dirac equation
for one electron in the field of one positive charge reads as
\begin{equation}
\left(e\phi + c(\alpha\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}})+\beta mc^2\right) \Psi = E \Psi.
\end{equation}

In non-relativistic quantum chemistry the solutions are separated into a radial
$R(r)$ and an angular part $Y(\theta,\phi)$.

\begin{equation}
\Psi^{NR}(r,\theta,\phi) = \frac1r R_{nl}(r)Y^{ml}_l(\theta,\phi)
\end{equation}
Here the angular part are described by the spherical harmonics
$Y_l^{m_l}(\theta,\phi)$.

Analogously the relativistic wave functions are separated, which leads to

\begin{equation}\label{seprel}
\Psi(r,\theta,\phi,\tau) = \frac1r \left( \begin{array}{rl}
P_{n\kappa}(r)  & \xi_{\kappa,m}(\theta,\phi)\\
iQ_{n\kappa}(r) & \xi_{-\kappa,m}(\theta,\phi)
\end{array}\right)
\end{equation}

Here, $P_{n\kappa}(r)$ and $Q_{n\kappa}(r)$ are the radial solutions of the
large and small component of the spinor, respectively. $\xi_{\kappa,m}(\theta,\phi)$
and $\xi_{-\kappa,m}(\theta,\phi)$ are two component spinors describing the
angular distribution. As in the non-relativistic approach, the radial solutions
depend on the principal quantum number $n$. Non-relativistically, the solutions
of the angular wave function depend on the azimuthal and magnetic quantum numbers
$l$ and $m_l$. However, another quantum number $\kappa=\mp(j+\frac12)$ needs to be
introduced in order to allow for a bijective function between the wave function
and the quantum number of the total angular momentum $j=l+s$.
proper eigenvalues.

The resulting angular wavefunction of a particle with a spin of $\frac12$ reads as

\begin{equation}\begin{array}{rcll}
\xi_{\kappa,m} &=& \frac1{\sqrt{2l+1}}\begin{pmatrix}\sqrt{l+m_l+1}Y_l^{m_l}\\\sqrt{l-m_l}Y_l^{m_l+1}\end{pmatrix} &\quad\text{f?r }\kappa<0\\\vphantom{\rule{0pt}{30pt}}
\xi_{\kappa,m} &=& \frac1{\sqrt{2l+1}}\begin{pmatrix}-\sqrt{l-m_l}Y_l^{m_l}\\\sqrt{l+m_l+1}Y_l^{m_l+1}\end{pmatrix} &\quad\text{f?r }\kappa>0\\
\end{array}\end{equation}

In table \ref{qzspinor} the non-ambiguous assignment of quantum numbers and atomic
spinors is illustrated.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccccccc}

        & $s_{\frac12}$ & $p_{\frac12}$ & $p_{\frac32}$ & $d_{\frac32}$ & $d_{\frac52}$ & $f_{\frac52}$ & $f_{\frac72}$\\\vphantom{\rule{0pt}{20pt}}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Assignment of the quantum numbers to two-component spinors.\cite{dyallfaegri}}
\label{qzspinor}
\end{table}

From the above considerations an expression for the energy of bound states can be
determined
\begin{equation}\label{HErel}
E = mc^2 \left[1+\frac1{c^2}\left(\frac1{n-|\kappa|+\sqrt{\kappa^2-\frac1{c^2}}}\right)^2\right]^{\frac12}
\end{equation}
Hence, the energy depends on the principal quantum number $n$ as well as the
relativistic quantum number $\kappa$. From equation (\ref{HErel}) it can be seen
that for a given azimuthal quantum number $l$ the splitting into states of quantum
numbers $j$ is achieved such that the state with the lower total angular momentum
has the lower energy.


\subsection{Many Particle Systems in Relativistic Quantum Chemistry}
\subsubsection{Dirac-Hartree-Fock}
Until now only the interaction of one electron with a static potential has been
discussed. However, in chemistry most systems contain several electrons, whose
interactions also have to be taken into account.
In non-relativistic quantum chemistry it is assumed that the Born Oppenheimer
approximation, which leads to a separation of electronic and nuclear solutions
is reasonable and then the electronic solutions are obtained using the Hartree-Fock
method. Here, a Hamiltonian of a $N$ electron system is applied, which contains
of a one particle and a two particle part. The one particle operator $\hat{h}(i)$
describe the kinetic energy of a single electron and its interaction with the
static Coulomb field of the nuclei and the two particle part $\mathbf{\hat{g}}_{ij}$
describes the interactions of the electrons amongst each other, which in the
non-relativistic case is the Coulomb operator $\frac1{r_{ij}}$.

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H}= \sum\limits_{i=1}^N \hat{h}(i) + \mathbf{\hat{g}}_{ij}
\end{equation}

From the solutions of the hydrogen atom the behaviour of an electron in a constant
Coulomb field is known. Inserting it into the latter equation yields the
relativistic Hamiltonian

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H}_{D}= \sum\limits_{i=1}^N (-e \phi(r_i)+c(\hat{\alpha}^{i}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}}^{i})+mc^2) + \mathbf{\hat{g}}_{ij}
\end{equation}

The electron-electron interaction term $\mathbf{\hat{g}}_{ij}$ can only be derived
from \ac{QED}, where the interaction of two moving particles is investigated.
The result is expanded in series of $\frac1c$ and truncated after the second
order term. This yields the Coulomb Breit term $\hat{g}_{ij}^{CB}$, which
contains the unretarded Coulomb interaction $\hat{g}_{ij}^C=\frac1{r_{ij}}$ and
the Breit term $\hat{g}_{ij}^B$.

\begin{equation}\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{g}_{ij}^{CB} &=& \hat{g}_{ij}^C + \hat{g}_{ij}^B\\
                &=& \frac1{r_{ij}} - \frac1{r_{ij}}\left(\alpha_i\cdot\alpha_j+\frac{(\alpha_i\cdot r_{ij})(\alpha_j\cdot r_{ij})}{r^2_{ij}}\right)
\end{array}\end{equation}

The latter can be divided into the Gaunt term
$\hat{g}_{ij}^G = - \frac1{r_{ij}}\alpha_i\cdot\alpha_j$ describing the interaction
with magnetic fields and a term purely containing retardation effects.
Since the Gaunt term is the largest contribution in the Breit term and the
implementation of the full Breit term is difficult, very often the Gaunt term only
is considered in numerical calculations.
However, the Breit term is damped by a factor of $\frac 1{c^2}$ hidden in the
$\alpha$ operators. Therefore it is normally applied for high precision calculations
only and the Dirac Coulomb operator $\mathcal{H}_{DC}$ is applied instead.

\begin{equation}\label{DCHamil}
\mathcal{H}_{DC} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^N (-e \phi(r_i)\mathds{1}+c\hat{\alpha}^{i}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}}^{i}+mc^2) + \sum\limits_{i>j}^N \frac1{r_{ij}}
\end{equation}


Since the Gaunt interaction has been shown to affect the ionization energies of
TlH by no more than \unit[0.06]{eV} \cite{Pernpointner05} and the errors of the
decay width calculations stemming from the use of $\mathcal{L}^2$ functions for
the determination of continuum properties are by far larger than the effect of the
Gaunt interaction, the Dirac Coulomb Hamiltonian is used throughout the thesis.
Even though this Hamiltonian is not Lorentz invariant the description is good
enough to cover all relevnt effects.

Starting from the Dirac Coulomb operator of equation (\ref{DCHamil}) it is assumed
that the wavefunction can be written as a anti-symmetrized product of one particle
wavefunctions $\phi_i$ called a Slater determinant as in the
non-relativistic quantum chemistry.

\begin{eqnarray}
\Psi &=& \mathcal{A} \left(\prod\limits_{i=1}^N\phi_i(r_i)\right)\\\vphantom{\rule{0pt}{50pt}}
     &=& \frac1{\sqrt{n!}}\begin{vmatrix}
\phi_1(r_1) & \phi_2(r_1) & \cdots & \phi_N(r_1)\\
\phi_1(r_2) & \phi_2(r_2) & \cdots & \phi_N(r_2)\\
\vdots      & \vdots     & \ddots  & \vdots\\
\phi_1(r_N) & \phi_2(r_N) & \cdots & \phi_N(r_N)\\
\end{vmatrix}
\end{eqnarray}

From this ansatz follows the energy as a functional:

\begin{eqnarray}
  E &=& \braket{\Psi|\mathcal{H}_{DC}|\Psi}\\\vphantom{\rule{0pt}{30pt}}
  &=& \sum\limits_{i=1}^N\braket{\phi_i|\hat{h}_D(i)|\phi_i}  + \frac12 \sum\limits_{i,j}^N\left(\braket{\phi_i\phi_j|\frac1{r_{ij}}|\phi_i\phi_j} - \braket{\phi_i\phi_j|\frac1{r_{ij}}|\phi_j\phi_i}\right)
\end{eqnarray}

From the latter expression the Dirac-Hartree-Fock equation is derived, which
describes each electron in an averaged field of the other electrons $v^{DHF}(i)$.

\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{f}_i\ket{\phi_i} &=& \left(\mathbf{h}_D(i) + v^{DHF}(i)\right)\ket{\phi_i}\\
                         &=& \left( \mathbf{h}_D(i) + \sum\limits_{l=1}^{N}(\mathbf{J}_l-\mathbf{K}_l)\right)\ket{\phi_i}\\
                         &=& \varepsilon_i\ket{\phi_i}
\end{eqnarray}

Here, the operators $\mathbf{J}_l$ and $\mathbf{K}_l$ both depend on the one
particle wavefunctions and denote the Coulomb and the
exchange term, respectively.
Starting from a scientific guess of the one particle wavefunctions, the Fock operator
$\mathbf{F}$ is constructed and applied to yield another set of one particle
wavefunctions. This iterative procedure is carried out until the system is
converged or \emph{self-consistent}, which is why the method is called a
\ac{SCF} method. \cite{szabo}

In non-relativistic quantum mechanics the variational principle ensures the
lowest energy solution to be closest to the true energy and hence the wavefunction
to be optimized. In relativistic quantum mechanics negative energy solutions
are possible but unphysical. The variational principle would therefore lead to
negative energy states. In order to prevent this so-called \emph{variational collapse},
the basis has to underlie certain restrictions, which will be discussed later in
section \ref{basis} about the construction of basis sets.
 
For the actual energy calculations the one particle wavefunctions \{$\phi_i$\}
are constructed as a linear combination of atomic wavefunctions. The latter are
expanded in a finite set of basis functions \{$\varphi_\mu$\} for the large and small
component. The resulting molecular one particle wavefunction then reads as
\begin{equation}
\phi_i = \sum\limits_\mu^{N^L} c_{\mu\alpha}^{iL} \varphi_{\mu\alpha}^L +  \sum\limits_\mu^{N^L} c_{\mu\beta}^{iL} \varphi_{\mu\beta}^L + \sum\limits_\mu^{N^S} c_{\mu\alpha}^{iS} \varphi_{\mu\alpha}^S + \sum\limits_\mu^{N^S} c_{\mu\beta}^{iS} \varphi_{\mu\beta}^S.
\end{equation}

Here, $N^L$ and $N^S$ are the numbers of basis functions of the large and small
component, respectively. This means that the energy depends on the expansion
coefficients $c_{\mu s}^{iX}$, where $X=L,S$ denotes the compoent of the spinor and
$s$ denotes the spin state. The resulting relativistic Roothan equations in matrix
notation read as

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{FC} = \mathcal{SCE}
\end{equation}

The Fock matrix Fockmatrix $\mathcal{F}$ and the overlap matrix $\mathcal{S}$
hereby consist of the matrix elements:

\begin{equation}\begin{array}{rcl}\label{roothanm}
F^{XY,sp}_{\mu\nu} &=& \braket{\varphi^X_{\mu s}|\mathbf{f}_i|\varphi_{\nu p}^Y}\\
S^{XY,sp}_{\mu\nu} &=& \braket{\varphi^X_{\mu s}|\varphi_{\nu p}^Y}
\end{array}\end{equation}

%\hat{U} = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
%\frac1{\sqrt{1+\hat{R}^\dagger\hat{R}}}          & \frac1{\sqrt{1+\hat{R}^\dagger\hat{R}}} \hat{R}^\dagger\\
%-\frac1{\sqrt{1+\hat{R}\hat{R}^\dagger}} \hat{R} & \frac1{\sqrt{1+\hat{R}\hat{R}^\dagger}}
%\end{array}\right)
%\end{equation}
%
%Da die Nichtdiagonalelemente des transformierten Hamiltonoperators 0 sein m?ssen, ergibt sich die Bedingung
%\begin{equation} \label{nondigbed}
%2mc^2\hat{R} = c (\mathbf{\sigma}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}}) + \left[V,\hat{R}\right] - \hat{R}c(\mathbf{\sigma}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}})\hat{R}.
%\end{equation}
%Im nicht-relativistischen Grenzfall ist der Kopplungsoperator $\hat{R}=\frac{(\mathbf{\sigma}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{p}})}{2mc}$ bekannt. Bei dessen Wahl als Startpunkt f?r eine iterative L?sung der Gleichung \ref{nondigbed} wird ersichtlich, dass immer h?here Ableitungen von $\hat{R}$ auftreten. Der Operator muss also angen?hert werden, wobei die beiden etabliertesten Methoden die Foldy-Wouthuysen-Methode und die Douglas-Kroll-Methode sind, die unterschiedliche Herangehensweise w?hlen. W?hrend die Foldy-Wouthuysen-Methode einen st?rungstheoretischen Ansatz verwendet, verwendet die Douglas-Kroll-Methode einen variationellen.
%
%Ein neuerer Ansatz manipuliert nicht den Kopplungsoperator $\hat{R}$, sondern verwendet eine algebraische Herangehensweise. Unter einmaliger Verwendung des Kopplungsoperators im nicht-relativistischen Grenzfall wird zun?chst die Dirac-Gleichung \ref{koppdirac} gel?st, in der die komplette Transformation enthalten ist. Aus den L?sungen wird auf die komplette Kopplungsmatrixmatrix $\mathbf{R}$ zur?ckgeschlossen, mit deren Hilfe dann die entkoppelten Hamiltonoperatoren f?r die postivien und die negativen Energien $\hat{h}_+$ und $\hat{h}_-$ konstruiert werden k?nnen. Auf diese Weise werden Operatoren erhalten, die im Vergleich zu denen der st?rungstheoretischen Foldy-Wouthuysen-Methode f?r die gew?hlte Basis in unendlicher Ordnung genau sind, weshalb die Methode IOTC (\emph{infinite-order two-component})\cite{Ilias07} genannt wird.\\
%Soll das IOTC nicht nur f?r die Beschreibung von Einteilchen-, sondern auch von Vielteilchensystemen verwendet werden, wird die sogenannte AMFI-Korrektur (\emph{atomic mean-field approximation to the spin-orbit interaction}) hinzugef?gt, die die Spin-Bahn-Kopp\-lung beschreibt und damit skalarrelativistische Ergebnisse um diesen Anteil korrigieren kann. Da bei der Berechnung der Korrektur nur die Integrale ?ber die Orbitale, die am selben Atom lokalisiert sind, ber?cksichtigt werden, sind f?r die Betrachtung von Molek?len geringe Abweichungen zum vierkomponentig ermittelten Resultat zu erwarten.\cite{Hess96}

\subsection{Construction of a Basis for the Relativistic Treatment}\label{basis}
As already discussed, the four components of a spinor are expanded into a finite
set of one particle basis functions. Thereby the basis sets of the large and small
component are treated separately.

\begin{equation}\begin{array}{ccc}
\phi_i^L = \begin{pmatrix}\phi^L_{i\alpha}\\\phi^L_{i\beta}\\0\\0\end{pmatrix} &\hspace{3em} &\phi_j^S = \begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\\phi^S_{j\alpha}\\\phi^S_{j\beta}\end{pmatrix}
\end{array}\end{equation}

The two components are expressed as linear combinations of scalar atomic
basis functions $\varphi_\mu^X$, which are weighted by the expansion coefficients
$c_{\mu s}^{iX}$.

\begin{equation}\begin{array}{ccc}
\phi^L_{is} = \sum\limits_{\mu=1}^{N^L} c_{\mu s}^{iL} \varphi_\mu^L &\hspace{3em}& \phi^S_{is} = \sum\limits_{\mu=1}^{N^S} c_{\mu s}^{iL} \varphi_\mu^S
\end{array}\end{equation}

They are constructed starting from the solutions of the hydrogen atom centered
at the corresponding atoms, which have the form
\begin{equation}
s_\tau^X = N_\tau^X r^{n-1}\mathrm{e}^{\alpha_\tau^X r}Y_l^{m_l}(\theta,\varphi)
\end{equation}

It is not possible to solve the associated integrals of the \emph{slater-type
functions} analytically and therefore, they are expanded into a set of primitive
Gauss functions $g_\tau^X$ yielding contracted Gauss functions.
These contracted Gauss functions do not show the correct asymptotic behaviour for
short and large distances ($r\rightarrow 0$, $r\rightarrow\infty$), but allow to
solve the integrals analytically and thereby reducing the computational cost.
In spherical coordinates they are given by
\begin{equation}
g_\tau^X = N_\tau^Xr^l\mathrm{e}^{-\alpha_\tau^Xr^2}Y_l^{m_l}(\theta,\varphi)
\end{equation}
and in cartesian coordinates by
\begin{equation}
g_\tau^X = N_\tau^X x^{n_x^X}y^{n_y^X}z^{n_z^X} \mathrm{e}^{-\alpha_\tau^Xr^2}.
\end{equation}

Here, $N_\tau^X$ denotes the normalization factor and the sum of the spacial
coordinate exponents $n_i^X$ corresponds to the azimuthal quantum number $l$.
\begin{equation}
n_x^X+n_y^X+n_z^X=l
\end{equation}
The final contraction then gives the basis functions
\begin{equation}
\varphi^X_\mu = \sum\limits_\tau d_{\mu\tau}^Xg_\tau^X,
\end{equation}
where the factor $d_{\mu\tau}^X$ weights the different primitive Gauss functions.

In order to prevent the variational collapse, the basis sets underly the condition
of the \emph{kinetic balance}, which is based on the non-relativistic limit of
equation (\ref{zusklgr}). Since the energy $E$ of the electron is much smaller than
$2mc^2$, the following relation between the coefficients
of the large and small component functions has to be obeyed.

\begin{equation}\label{kinbal}
\phi_S = \frac1{2mc}(\sigma\cdot\hat{p})\,\phi_L
\end{equation}

Using such bases prevents a \emph{variational collapse} in calculation based on
the variational principle.

The kinetic energy operator $\alpha\cdot\hat{\pi}$ creates from a given basis
function of the large component with a distinct $l$ value two functions of the small
component with $l-1$ and $l+1$. This means that the basis of the small component
contains almost twice as many basis functions as the basis of the large component.
Hence the computational cost of a relativistic calculation is higher than the
non-relativistic correspondence.
