\section{FanoADC}
In the FanoADC, we use the discrete ADC Hamiltonian in the \ac{ISR}
basis for the construction of the pseudo-spectrum of the decay width
$\Gamma$.
Therefore
Due to multiple possible final states, we employ the procedure
of Feshbach using projection operators for the partitioning of the Hamiltonian
into an initial and a final state subspace.
The processes of our interest have a singly ionized initial state and a
doubly charged final state with an additional electron in the continuum.
Therefore, the final state configurations are chosen from
the class of $2h1p$ states, where the $2h$ part is assumed to
describe the doubly ionized final state and the particle maps the continuum electron.
The initial state in a zeroth order approximation can be described as a $1h$ state.

In the actual partitioning, all $2h1p$ with the $2h$ part corresponding to
a final state configuration are chosen to be part of the final states.
All $1h$ configurations and those $2h1p$ configurations not corresponding
to a possible final state configuration are used for a better description
of the initial state. This leads to a resorted \ac{ADC} matrix as shown in
figure \ref{figure:fano_matsort}, where the subspace of the initial state
is denoted by $\mathbf{M}$, the final state subspace by $\mathbf{N}$ and
the interaction coupling those two subsets is named $\mathbf{W}$.

The separate diagonalization of the initial and final state subspaces
$\mathbf{M}$ and $\mathbf{N}$ yield
the corresponding eigenvectors and eigenvalues on the diagonal of the
matrices $\mathbf{\Lambda}$ and $\mathbf{\Omega}$

\begin{align}
  \mathbf{\Lambda} &= \mathbf{I}^T \mathbf{M} \mathbf{I}  \\
  \mathbf{\Omega}  &= \mathbf{F}^T \mathbf{N} \mathbf{F} 
\end{align}

and the Hamiltonian is represented in the basis of their eigenstates
as illustrated in
figure \ref{figure:fano_bastrans} with $\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{I}^T \mathbf{W} \mathbf{F}$
being the interaction part
in this new basis.

The desired pseudo-spectrum is then obtained from the final state energies
$\bar{\omega}_\beta$ and the interaction part in the basis of the initial and
final eigenstates for a specific initial state choice $i$ and possibly a choice
of channel $\beta$
$V_{i,\beta} = \braket{\phi |\hat{H}| \psi_{\beta, 2h1p}}$.
