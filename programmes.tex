\chapter{Programs and Scripts}
\label{app:programs}

This chapter gives an introduction to the programs and special scripts
written during the PhD, which are used in this thesis. The aim is
to give insight into the structure of the programs rather than repeating
the manual, if it is given elsewhere. This is the case for HARDRoC
\cite{HARDRoC} and the relativistic FanoADC-Stieltjes implemented in Dirac
\cite{DIRAC13}.
